## Advantages

- We can traverse the whole list from any node
- We can insert any item at both beginning and end at O(1) time by maintaining just one pointer. (can be useful for queue implementatio)
- Efficient implementation of algorithms like Round Robin

## Disadvantages

- Codes for traversal, insertion, deletion become slightly conmplex

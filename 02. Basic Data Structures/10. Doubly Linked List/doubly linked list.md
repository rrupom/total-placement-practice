## Advantages over singly linked list
- Can be traversed in both direction
- We can delete a given node in O(1) time
- We can insert/delete a new node before a given node in O(1) time.

## Disadvantages
- Space required for extra pointer with every node
- The doubly linked list code becomes more complex as extra pointer has to be maintained everytime.
